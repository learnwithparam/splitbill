name: factory-build
description: Implements an approved plan test-first, applies the named repo skills, and runs the repo's gate script, quoting the gate line verbatim in the status comment. Use as the build stage, after a plan has been approved (or was auto-approve-eligible).

# factory-build

Invoked as `/factory-build <N>`. No push, no `gh` access — the runner
commits and pushes what's in the worktree after you stop; you only edit
files inside this worktree and write the artifact files below.

## 1. Read the inputs

- `.factory/runs/issue-<N>/issue.json`, `triage.json`, `plan.json`,
  `plan-comment.md` — the approved plan: AC-n, NG-n, files, tests, repo
  skills to apply, gate level.
- `AGENTS.md`, `.factory/charter.md`.
- The repo skills named in the plan (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) —
  read and follow them; they encode repo-specific rules you don't know.

## 2. Build to the plan's proof, smallest change

Read `plan.json`'s `proof` (absent means `test`).

- **`test`**: for each AC, write its named test first, watch it fail for the
  right reason, then write the smallest change that makes it pass.
- **`check`**: no test file is expected. For each AC, run the plan's named
  check command against your change and confirm it proves that AC (e.g. a
  repo-specific audit script reports the fixed line, a prose lint reports
  clean, a link check finds no dead link). Re-run every named check before
  step 3, not just the one for the AC you just touched.

Either way: do not touch a file outside the plan's "files to touch" list
without a real reason — if you find you need to, that's a signal to stop and
ask (step 5), not to quietly expand scope. Never cross a non-goal (NG-n);
those are binding.

Apply every repo skill named in the plan as you go, not as an afterthought.

## 3. Run the gate

Run `.factory/gates.sh` (or the narrower `gate_level` the plan named).
Quote the exact gate line — the command and its pass/fail output — verbatim
in the status comment. Do not paraphrase or summarize a failure as "some
tests failed"; show the line that failed.

If the gate fails and you can see why, fix it and re-run. Stop after 3
failed gate runs: write `"outcome": "blocked"` and say so in the status
comment. If you can't get it green, say so in the status comment and stop — `factory-verify` will catch a red gate anyway, but a
build that knows it's broken shouldn't pretend otherwise.

## 4. UI route: capture screenshots

Skip unless `triage.json`'s `type` is `ui`. `.claude/skills/lwp-design/SKILL.md`
names the state list, rubric and playwright-cli commands; follow it. For
every state x viewport (390, 1440) x theme (light, dark) the plan's AC-n
list covers, run the real built page through real auth and data (no mocked
render), save the PNG at `docs/design/reviews/issue-<N>/<state>-<viewport>-<theme>.png`
and stage it (`git add docs/design/reviews/`, the runner pushes it like any
other file), then record `{ "state", "viewport", "theme", "path" }` in
`build.json`'s `screenshots` array. An empty or missing array is not
done; `factory-verify` rejects it for missing coverage.

## 5. Escape hatch: back to needs-info mid-build

If the plan turns out to rest on a wrong assumption, or you hit a decision
only a human can make, stop here rather than guessing:

- Write `.factory/runs/issue-<N>/question-comment.md` with the
  `factory-comment` skill's `question.md` template.
- Write `.factory/runs/issue-<N>/build.json` with `"status": "needs-info"`.
- Leave the worktree and any partial commits as they are — the runner
  preserves both the worktree and the current stage so build can resume
  from here once the question is answered, instead of starting over.

## 6. Write the outputs

Write `.factory/runs/issue-<N>/status-comment.md` using the
`factory-comment` skill's `status.md` template (stage `build`, progress
`3/5`, the gate line, one-line detail). Then write
`.factory/runs/issue-<N>/build.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "green",
  "gate_line": "FACTORY_GATES: status=GREEN passed=1 failed=0 skipped=0",
  "rounds": 1
}
```

Add `"screenshots": [...]` (step 4) only on the `ui` route.

`outcome` is optional: `complete` (the default), `blocked` (you cannot go on and a human must
look; put the reason in `summary`), or `failed`. No other fields are allowed.

`status` is one of `green`, `red` (gate never went green after reasonable
effort), or `needs-info` (see step 5). Write `"rounds": 1`: the runner counts
build attempts itself and replaces the value. Leave the worktree exactly as you want
it committed — the runner commits and pushes it verbatim.
